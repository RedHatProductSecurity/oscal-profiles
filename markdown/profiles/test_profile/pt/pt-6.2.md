## Control guidance

The [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) includes two sets of provisions that allow federal agencies to claim exemptions from certain requirements in the statute. In certain circumstances, these provisions allow agencies to promulgate regulations to exempt a system of records from select provisions of the [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) . At a minimum, organizationsâ€™ [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) exemption regulations include the specific name(s) of any system(s) of records that will be exempt, the specific provisions of the [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) from which the system(s) of records is to be exempted, the reasons for the exemption, and an explanation for why the exemption is both necessary and appropriate.

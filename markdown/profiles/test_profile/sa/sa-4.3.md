# sa-4.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Development Methods, Techniques, and Practices

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes:

- \[(a)\] {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.01 }};

- \[(b)\] {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.02 }} ; and

- \[(c)\] {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.05 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-04(03)(a)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.01 }};

- \[SA-04(03)(b)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.02 }};

- \[SA-04(03)(c)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes {{ insert: param, sa-04.03_odp.05 }}.

## Control guidance

Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity of latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the number and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Transparency in the methods and techniques that developers select and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering, software development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system component, or system service being acquired.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

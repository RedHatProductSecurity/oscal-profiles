# sa-3.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Technology Refresh

## Control Statement

Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout the system development life cycle.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-03(03)[01]\] a technology refresh schedule is planned for the system throughout the system development life cycle;

- \[SA-03(03)[02]\] a technology refresh schedule is implemented for the system throughout the system development life cycle.

## Control guidance

Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware, processes, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities. The use of obsolete or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security and privacy risks associated with unsupported components, counterfeit or repurposed components, components unable to implement security or privacy requirements, slow or inoperable components, components from untrusted sources, inadvertent personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology refreshes typically occur during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->

# sa-15.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Criticality Analysis

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality analysis:

- \[(a)\] At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: {{ insert: param, sa-15.03_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] At the following level of rigor: {{ insert: param, sa-15.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-15(03)(a)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform a criticality analysis at {{ insert: param, sa-15.03_odp.01 }} in the system development life cycle;

- \[SA-15(03)(b)\]

  - \[SA-15(03)(b)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform a criticality analysis at the following rigor level: {{ insert: param, sa-15.03_odp.02 }};
  - \[SA-15(03)(b)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform a criticality analysis at the following rigor level: {{ insert: param, sa-15.03_odp.03 }} .

## Control guidance

Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

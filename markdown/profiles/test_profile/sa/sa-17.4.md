# sa-17.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Informal Correspondence

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- \[(a)\] Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

- \[(b)\] Show via {{ insert: param, sa-17.04_odp }} that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

- \[(c)\] Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

- \[(d)\] Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

- \[(e)\] Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-17(04)(a)\]

  - \[SA-17(04)(a)[01]\] as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions;
  - \[SA-17(04)(a)[02]\] as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of error messages;
  - \[SA-17(04)(a)[03]\] as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce an informal, descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of effects;

- \[SA-17(04)(b)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show via {{ insert: param, sa-17.04_odp }} that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

- \[SA-17(04)(c)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show via informal demonstration that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

- \[SA-17(04)(d)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

- \[SA-17(04)(e)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms that are not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but are strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## Control guidance

Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model, and that additional code or implementation detail has no impact on the behaviors or policies being modeled. Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., high-level/low-level design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal and informal methods may be needed to show such consistency. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware include mapping registers and direct memory input and output.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# sa-15.7 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Automated Vulnerability Analysis

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }} to:

- \[(a)\] Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.02 }};

- \[(b)\] Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;

- \[(c)\] Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and

- \[(d)\] Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.03 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-15(07)(a)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform automated vulnerability analysis {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.02 }};

- \[SA-15(07)(b)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }};

- \[SA-15(07)(c)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to determine potential risk mitigations {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }} for delivered vulnerabilities;

- \[SA-15(07)(d)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, sa-15.07_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or deficiencies in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations for risk mitigations.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

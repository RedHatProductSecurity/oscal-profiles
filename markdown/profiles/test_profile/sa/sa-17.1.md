# sa-17.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Formal Policy Model

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- \[(a)\] Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the {{ insert: param, sa-17.1_prm_1 }} to be enforced; and

- \[(b)\] Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security and privacy policy when implemented.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-17(01)(a)\]

  - \[SA-17(01)(a)[01]\] as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a formal policy model describing the {{ insert: param, sa-17.01_odp.01 }} to be enforced;
  - \[SA-17(01)(a)[02]\] as an integral part of the development process, the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to produce a formal policy model describing the {{ insert: param, sa-17.01_odp.02 }} to be enforced;

- \[SA-17(01)(b)\]

  - \[SA-17(01)(b)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented;
  - \[SA-17(01)(b)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational privacy policy when implemented.

## Control guidance

Formal models describe specific behaviors or security and privacy policies using formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors and policies to be formally proven. Not all components of systems can be modeled. Generally, formal specifications are scoped to the behaviors or policies of interest, such as nondiscretionary access control policies. Organizations choose the formal modeling language and approach based on the nature of the behaviors and policies to be described and the available tools.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

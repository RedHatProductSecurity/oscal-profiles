# sa-3.2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Use of Live or Operational Data

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Approve, document, and control the use of live data in preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system service; and

- \[(b)\] Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or system service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use within the preproduction environments.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-03(02)a.\]

  - \[SA-03(02)a.[01]\] the use of live data in pre-production environments is approved for the system, system component, or system service;
  - \[SA-03(02)a.[02]\] the use of live data in pre-production environments is documented for the system, system component, or system service;
  - \[SA-03(02)a.[03]\] the use of live data in pre-production environments is controlled for the system, system component, or system service;

- \[SA-03(02)b.\] pre-production environments for the system, system component, or system service are protected at the same impact or classification level as any live data in use within the pre-production environments.

## Control guidance

Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or operational data in preproduction (i.e., development, test, and integration) environments can result in significant risks to organizations. In addition, the use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such information. Therefore, it is important for the organization to manage any additional risks that may result from the use of live or operational data. Organizations can minimize such risks by using test or dummy data during the design, development, and testing of systems, system components, and system services. Risk assessment techniques may be used to determine if the risk of using live or operational data is acceptable.

<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

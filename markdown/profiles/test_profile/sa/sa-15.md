# sa-15 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Development Process, Standards, and Tools

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:

  - \[1.\] Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;
  - \[2.\] Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
  - \[3.\] Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
  - \[4.\] Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and

- \[b.\] Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations {{ insert: param, sa-15_odp.01 }} to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the following security and privacy requirements: {{ insert: param, sa-15_prm_2 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-15a.\]

  - \[SA-15a.01\]

    - \[SA-15a.01[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that explicitly addresses security requirements;
    - \[SA-15a.01[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that explicitly addresses privacy requirements;

  - \[SA-15a.02\]

    - \[SA-15a.02[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that identifies the standards used in the development process;
    - \[SA-15a.02[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that identifies the tools used in the development process;

  - \[SA-15a.03\]

    - \[SA-15a.03[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that documents the specific tool used in the development process;
    - \[SA-15a.03[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that documents the specific tool configurations used in the development process;

  - \[SA-15a.04\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process that documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development;

- \[SA-15b.\]

  - \[SA-15b.[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process in which the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations are reviewed {{ insert: param, sa-15_odp.01 }} to determine that the process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations selected and employed satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-15_odp.02 }};
  - \[SA-15b.[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to follow a documented development process in which the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations are reviewed {{ insert: param, sa-15_odp.01 }} to determine that the process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations selected and employed satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-15_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

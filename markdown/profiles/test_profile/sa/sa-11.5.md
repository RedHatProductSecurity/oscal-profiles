# sa-11.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Penetration Testing

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform penetration testing:

- \[(a)\] At the following level of rigor: {{ insert: param, sa-11.5_prm_1 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Under the following constraints: {{ insert: param, sa-11.05_odp.03 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-11(05)(a)\]

  - \[SA-11(05)(a)[01]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform penetration testing at the following level of rigor: {{ insert: param, sa-11.05_odp.01 }};
  - \[SA-11(05)(a)[02]\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform penetration testing at the following level of rigor: {{ insert: param, sa-11.05_odp.02 }};

- \[SA-11(05)(b)\] the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required to perform penetration testing under {{ insert: param, sa-11.05_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors, using all available information technology product or system documentation and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent the implemented security and privacy features of information technology products and systems. Useful information for assessors who conduct penetration testing includes product and system design specifications, source code, and administrator and operator manuals. Penetration testing can include white-box, gray-box, or black-box testing with analyses performed by skilled professionals who simulate adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to discover vulnerabilities in systems, system components, and services that result from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide a greater level of analysis than would ordinarily be possible. When user session information and other personally identifiable information is captured or recorded during penetration testing, such information is handled appropriately to protect privacy.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-11(03)(a)\]

  - \[SA-11(03)(a)[01]\] an independent agent is required to satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-11.03_odp }} to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and the evidence produced during testing and evaluation;
  - \[SA-11(03)(a)[02]\] an independent agent is required to satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-11.03_odp }} to verify the correct implementation of the developer privacy assessment plan and the evidence produced during testing and evaluation;

- \[SA-11(03)(b)\] the independent agent is provided with sufficient information to complete the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

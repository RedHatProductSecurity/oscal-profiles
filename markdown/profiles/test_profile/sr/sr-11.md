# sr-11 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Component Authenticity

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the system; and

- \[b.\] Report counterfeit system components to {{ insert: param, sr-11_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SR-11a.\]

  - \[SR-11a.[01]\] an anti-counterfeit policy is developed and implemented;
  - \[SR-11a.[02]\] anti-counterfeit procedures are developed and implemented;
  - \[SR-11a.[03]\] the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to detect counterfeit components entering the system;
  - \[SR-11a.[04]\] the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to prevent counterfeit components from entering the system;

- \[SR-11b.\] counterfeit system components are reported to {{ insert: param, sr-11_odp.01 }}.

## Control guidance

Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include CISA.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# pe-13.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Suppression Systems â€” Automatic Activation and Notification

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.01 }} and {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.02 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-13(02)(a)\]

  - \[PE-13(02)(a)[01]\] fire suppression systems that activate automatically are employed;
  - \[PE-13(02)(a)[02]\] fire suppression systems that notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.01 }} automatically are employed;
  - \[PE-13(02)(a)[03]\] fire suppression systems that notify {{ insert: param, pe-13.02_odp.02 }} automatically are employed;

- \[PE-13(02)(b)\] an automatic fire suppression capability is employed when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.

## Control guidance

Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the impact level or classification of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# pe-17 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Alternate Work Site

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Determine and document the {{ insert: param, pe-17_odp.01 }} allowed for use by employees;

- \[b.\] Employ the following controls at alternate work sites: {{ insert: param, pe-17_odp.02 }};

- \[c.\] Assess the effectiveness of controls at alternate work sites; and

- \[d.\] Provide a means for employees to communicate with information security and privacy personnel in case of incidents.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-17a.\] {{ insert: param, pe-17_odp.01 }} are determined and documented;

- \[PE-17b.\] {{ insert: param, pe-17_odp.02 }} are employed at alternate work sites;

- \[PE-17c.\] the effectiveness of controls at alternate work sites is assessed;

- \[PE-17d.\] a means for employees to communicate with information security and privacy personnel in case of incidents is provided.

## Control guidance

Alternate work sites include government facilities or the private residences of employees. While distinct from alternative processing sites, alternate work sites can provide readily available alternate locations during contingency operations. Organizations can define different sets of controls for specific alternate work sites or types of sites depending on the work-related activities conducted at the sites. Implementing and assessing the effectiveness of organization-defined controls and providing a means to communicate incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency planning activities of organizations.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# pe-11.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Alternate Power Supply — Minimal Operational Capability

## Control Statement

Provide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }} and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-11(01)[01]\] an alternate power supply provided for the system is activated {{ insert: param, pe-11.01_odp }};

- \[PE-11(01)[02]\] the alternate power supply provided for the system can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.

## Control guidance

Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

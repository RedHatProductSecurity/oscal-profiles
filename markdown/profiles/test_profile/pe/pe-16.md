# pe-16 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Delivery and Removal

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Authorize and control {{ insert: param, pe-16_prm_1 }} entering and exiting the facility; and

- \[b.\] Maintain records of the system components.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-16a.\]

  - \[PE-16a.[01]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.01 }} are authorized when entering the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[02]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.01 }} are controlled when entering the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[03]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.02 }} are authorized when exiting the facility;
  - \[PE-16a.[04]\] {{ insert: param, pe-16_odp.02 }} are controlled when exiting the facility;

- \[PE-16b.\] records of the system components are maintained.

## Control guidance

Enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of system components may require restricting access to delivery areas and isolating the areas from the system and media libraries.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

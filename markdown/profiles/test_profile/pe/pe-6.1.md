# pe-6.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Intrusion Alarms and Surveillance Equipment

## Control Statement

Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-06(01)[01]\] physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored using physical intrusion alarms;

- \[PE-06(01)[02]\] physical access to the facility where the system resides is monitored using physical surveillance equipment.

## Control guidance

Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in conjunction with physical barriers, physical access control systems, and security guards by triggering a response when these other forms of security have been compromised or breached. Physical intrusion alarms can include different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, contact sensors, and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras installed at strategic locations throughout the facility.

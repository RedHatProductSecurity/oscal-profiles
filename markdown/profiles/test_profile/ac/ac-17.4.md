# ac-17.4 - \[Access Control\] Privileged Commands and Access

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides assessable evidence and for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.4_prm_1 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-17(04)(a)\]

  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[01]\] the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[02]\] access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only in a format that provides assessable evidence;
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[03]\] the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.04_odp.01 }};
  - \[AC-17(04)(a)[04]\] access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only for the following needs: {{ insert: param, ac-17.04_odp.02 }};

- \[AC-17(04)(b)\] the rationale for remote access is documented in the security plan for the system.

## Control guidance

Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to threats by adversaries to the remote access capability.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

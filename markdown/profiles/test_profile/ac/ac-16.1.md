# ac-16.1 - \[Access Control\] Dynamic Attribute Association

## Control Statement

Dynamically associate security and privacy attributes with {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_1 }} in accordance with the following security and privacy policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-16(01)[01]\] security attributes are dynamically associated with {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.01 }} in accordance with the following security policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.05 }};

- \[AC-16(01)[02]\] security attributes are dynamically associated with {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.02 }} in accordance with the following security policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.05 }};

- \[AC-16(01)[03]\] privacy attributes are dynamically associated with {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.03 }} in accordance with the following privacy policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.06 }};

- \[AC-16(01)[04]\] privacy attributes are dynamically associated with {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.04 }} in accordance with the following privacy policies as information is created and combined: {{ insert: param, ac-16.01_odp.06 }}.

## Control guidance

Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or privacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to information aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges), changes in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies. Attributes may also change situationally.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

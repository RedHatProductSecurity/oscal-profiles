# ac-16.3 - \[Access Control\] Maintenance of Attribute Associations by System

## Control Statement

Maintain the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.3_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.3_prm_2 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-16(03)[01]\] the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.03 }} is maintained;

- \[AC-16(03)[02]\] the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.01 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.04 }} is maintained.

- \[AC-16(03)[03]\] the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.02 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.05 }} is maintained;

- \[AC-16(03)[04]\] the association and integrity of {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.02 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-16.03_odp.06 }} is maintained.

## Control guidance

Maintaining the association and integrity of security and privacy attributes to subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. The integrity of specific items, such as security configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring mechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from "known good" baselines. Automated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions, information flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

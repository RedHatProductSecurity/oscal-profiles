# ac-16.6 - \[Access Control\] Maintenance of Attribute Association

## Control Statement

Require personnel to associate and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_2 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.6_prm_3 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-16(06)[01]\] personnel are required to associate and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.01 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.05 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.09 }};

- \[AC-16(06)[02]\] personnel are required to associate and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.02 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.06 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.09 }};

- \[AC-16(06)[03]\] personnel are required to associate and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.03 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.07 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.10 }};

- \[AC-16(06)[04]\] personnel are required to associate and maintain the association of {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.04 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.08 }} in accordance with {{ insert: param, ac-16.06_odp.10 }}.

## Control guidance

Maintaining attribute association requires individual users (as opposed to the system) to maintain associations of defined security and privacy attributes with subjects and objects.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

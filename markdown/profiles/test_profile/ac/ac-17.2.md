# ac-17.2 - \[Access Control\] Protection of Confidentiality and Integrity Using Encryption

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control Assessment Objective

cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

## Control guidance

Virtual private networks can be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an example of a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end communications security over networks and is used for Internet communications and online transactions.

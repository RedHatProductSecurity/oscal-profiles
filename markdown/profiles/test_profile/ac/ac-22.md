# ac-22 - \[Access Control\] Publicly Accessible Content

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible;

- \[b.\] Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

- \[c.\] Review the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and

- \[d.\] Review the content on the publicly accessible system for nonpublic information {{ insert: param, ac-22_odp }} and remove such information, if discovered.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-22a.\] designated individuals are authorized to make information publicly accessible;

- \[AC-22b.\] authorized individuals are trained to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain non-public information;

- \[AC-22c.\] the proposed content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that non-public information is not included;

- \[AC-22d.\]

  - \[AC-22d.[01]\] the content on the publicly accessible system is reviewed for non-public information {{ insert: param, ac-22_odp }};
  - \[AC-22d.[02]\] non-public information is removed from the publicly accessible system, if discovered.

## Control guidance

In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have access to nonpublic information, including information protected under the [PRIVACT](#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455) and proprietary information. Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such information publicly accessible.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

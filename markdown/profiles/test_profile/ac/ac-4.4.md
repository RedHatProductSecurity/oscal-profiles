# ac-4.4 - \[Access Control\] Flow Control of Encrypted Information

## Control Statement

Prevent encrypted information from bypassing {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.01 }} by {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.02 }}.

- \[4_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider must support Agency requirements to comply with M-21-31 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf) and M-22-09 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf).

## Control Assessment Objective

encrypted information is prevented from bypassing {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.01 }} by {{ insert: param, ac-04.04_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Flow control mechanisms include content checking, security policy filters, and data type identifiers. The term encryption is extended to cover encoded data not recognized by filtering mechanisms.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

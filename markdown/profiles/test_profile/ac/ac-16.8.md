# ac-16.8 - \[Access Control\] Association Techniques and Technologies

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, ac-16.8_prm_1 }} in associating security and privacy attributes to information.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-16(08)[01]\] {{ insert: param, ac-16.08_odp.01 }} are implemented in associating security attributes to information;

- \[AC-16(08)[02]\] {{ insert: param, ac-16.08_odp.02 }} are implemented in associating privacy attributes to information.

## Control guidance

The association of security and privacy attributes to information within systems is important for conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such attributes to information (i.e., binding) can be accomplished with technologies and techniques that provide different levels of assurance. For example, systems can cryptographically bind attributes to information using digital signatures that support cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

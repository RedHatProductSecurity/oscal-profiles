# ir-4.7 - \[Incident Response\] Insider Threats — Intra-organization Coordination

## Control Statement

Coordinate an incident handling capability for insider threats that includes the following organizational entities {{ insert: param, ir-04.07_odp }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[IR-04(07)[01]\] an incident handling capability is coordinated for insider threats;

- \[IR-04(07)[02]\] the coordinated incident handling capability includes {{ insert: param, ir-04.07_odp }}.

## Control guidance

Incident handling for insider threat incidents (e.g., preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires coordination among many organizational entities, including mission or business owners, system owners, human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel offices, physical security offices, senior agency information security officer, operations personnel, risk executive (function), senior agency official for privacy, and legal counsel. In addition, organizations may require external support from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# ir-3.3 - \[Incident Response\] Continuous Improvement

## Control Statement

Use qualitative and quantitative data from testing to:

- \[(a)\] Determine the effectiveness of incident response processes;

- \[(b)\] Continuously improve incident response processes; and

- \[(c)\] Provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate, consistent, and in a reproducible format.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[IR-03(03)(a)\]

  - \[IR-03(03)(a)[01]\] qualitative data from testing are used to determine the effectiveness of incident response processes;
  - \[IR-03(03)(a)[02]\] quantitative data from testing are used to determine the effectiveness of incident response processes;

- \[IR-03(03)(b)\]

  - \[IR-03(03)(b)[01]\] qualitative data from testing are used to continuously improve incident response processes;
  - \[IR-03(03)(b)[02]\] quantitative data from testing are used to continuously improve incident response processes;

- \[IR-03(03)(c)\]

  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[01]\] qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate;
  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[02]\] quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are accurate;
  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[03]\] qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are consistent;
  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[04]\] quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics that are consistent;
  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[05]\] qualitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics in a reproducible format;
  - \[IR-03(03)(c)[06]\] quantitative data from testing are used to provide incident response measures and metrics in a reproducible format.

## Control guidance

To help incident response activities function as intended, organizations may use metrics and evaluation criteria to assess incident response programs as part of an effort to continually improve response performance. These efforts facilitate improvement in incident response efficacy and lessen the impact of incidents.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# au-12 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Record Generation

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing as defined in [AU-2a](#au-2_smt.a) on {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.01 }};

- \[b.\] Allow {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.02 }} to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

- \[c.\] Generate audit records for the event types defined in [AU-2c](#au-2_smt.c) that include the audit record content defined in [AU-3](#au-3).

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AU-12a.\] audit record generation capability for the event types the system is capable of auditing (defined in AU-02_ODP[01]) is provided by {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.01 }};

- \[AU-12b.\] {{ insert: param, au-12_odp.02 }} is/are allowed to select the event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system;

- \[AU-12c.\] audit records for the event types defined in AU-02_ODP[02] that include the audit record content defined in AU-03 are generated.

## Control guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The event types specified in [AU-2d](#au-2_smt.d) are the event types for which audit logs are to be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can generate audit records.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

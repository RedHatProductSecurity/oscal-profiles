# au-12.3 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Changes by Authorized Individuals

## Control Statement

Provide and implement the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.01 }} to change the logging to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.02 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.03 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.04 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AU-12(03)[01]\] the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.01 }} to change the logging to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.02 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.03 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.04 }} is provided;

- \[AU-12(03)[02]\] the capability for {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.01 }} to change the logging to be performed on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.02 }} based on {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.03 }} within {{ insert: param, au-12.03_odp.04 }} is implemented.

## Control guidance

Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables organizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Logging that is limited to conserve system resources may be extended (either temporarily or permanently) to address certain threat situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a specific set of event types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near real-time, within minutes, or within hours).

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

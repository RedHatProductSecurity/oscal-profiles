# au-10.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Validate Binding of Information Producer Identity

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Validate the binding of the information producer identity to the information at {{ insert: param, au-10.02_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Perform {{ insert: param, au-10.02_odp.02 }} in the event of a validation error.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AU-10(02)(a)\] the binding of the information producer identity to the information is validated at {{ insert: param, au-10.02_odp.01 }};

- \[AU-10(02)(b)\] {{ insert: param, au-10.02_odp.02 }} in the event of a validation error are performed.

## Control guidance

Validating the binding of the information producer identity to the information prevents the modification of information between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved by, for example, using cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

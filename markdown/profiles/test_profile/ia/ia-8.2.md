# ia-8.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of External Authenticators

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and

- \[(b)\] Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[IA-08(02)(a)\] only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant are accepted;

- \[IA-08(02)(b)\]

  - \[IA-08(02)(b)[01]\] a list of accepted external authenticators is documented;
  - \[IA-08(02)(b)[02]\] a list of accepted external authenticators is maintained.

## Control guidance

Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government entities and are compliant with [SP 800-63B](#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce) . Approved external authenticators meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a specified authenticator assurance level.

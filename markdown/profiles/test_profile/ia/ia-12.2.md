# ia-12.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Identity Evidence

## Control Statement

Require evidence of individual identification be presented to the registration authority.

## Control Assessment Objective

evidence of individual identification is presented to the registration authority.

## Control guidance

Identity evidence, such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity or at least increases the work factor of potential adversaries. The forms of acceptable evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the userâ€™s account.

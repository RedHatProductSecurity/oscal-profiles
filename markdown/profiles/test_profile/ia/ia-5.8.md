# ia-5.8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Multiple System Accounts

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, ia-05.08_odp }} to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

- \[8_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

{{ insert: param, ia-05.08_odp }} are implemented to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

## Control guidance

If a single user authentication domain is used to access multiple systems, such as in single-sign-on, then only a single authenticator is required.
When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same authenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches include having different authenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing a single sign-on or federation mechanism, or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems. Organizations can also use rules of behavior (see [PL-4](#pl-4) ) and access agreements (see [PS-6](#ps-6) ) to mitigate the risk of multiple system accounts.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# ia-5.5 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Change Authenticators Prior to Delivery

## Control Statement

Require developers and installers of system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.

## Control Assessment Objective

developers and installers of system components are required to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.

## Control guidance

Changing authenticators prior to the delivery and installation of system components extends the requirement for organizations to change default authenticators upon system installation by requiring developers and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to developers of commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. Requirements for unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations when procuring systems or system components.

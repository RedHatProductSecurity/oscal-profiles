# si-4.12 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Automated Organization-generated Alerts

## Control Statement

Alert {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.01 }} using {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.02 }} when the following indications of inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications occur: {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.03 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

{{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.01 }} is/are alerted using {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.02 }} when {{ insert: param, si-04.12_odp.03 }} indicate inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications.

## Control guidance

Organizational personnel on the system alert notification list include system administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, system security officers, or privacy officers. Automated organization-generated alerts are the security alerts generated by organizations and transmitted using automated means. The sources for organization-generated alerts are focused on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider threats. In contrast to alerts generated by the organization, alerts generated by the system in [SI-4(5)](#si-4.5) focus on information sources that are internal to the systems, such as audit records.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# si-4.13 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Analyze Traffic and Event Patterns

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Analyze communications traffic and event patterns for the system;

- \[(b)\] Develop profiles representing common traffic and event patterns; and

- \[(c)\] Use the traffic and event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-04(13)(a)\]

  - \[SI-04(13)(a)[01]\] communications traffic for the system is analyzed;
  - \[SI-04(13)(a)[02]\] event patterns for the system are analyzed;

- \[SI-04(13)(b)\]

  - \[SI-04(13)(b)[01]\] profiles representing common traffic are developed;
  - \[SI-04(13)(b)[02]\] profiles representing event patterns are developed;

- \[SI-04(13)(c)\]

  - \[SI-04(13)(c)[01]\] traffic profiles are used in tuning system-monitoring devices;
  - \[SI-04(13)(c)[02]\] event profiles are used in tuning system-monitoring devices.

## Control guidance

Identifying and understanding common communications traffic and event patterns help organizations provide useful information to system monitoring devices to more effectively identify suspicious or anomalous traffic and events when they occur. Such information can help reduce the number of false positives and false negatives during system monitoring.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

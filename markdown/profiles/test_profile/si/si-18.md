# si-18 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Personally Identifiable Information Quality Operations

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Check the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle {{ insert: param, si-18_prm_1 }} ; and

- \[b.\] Correct or delete inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-18a.\]

  - \[SI-18a.[01]\] the accuracy of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle is checked {{ insert: param, si-18_odp.01 }};
  - \[SI-18a.[02]\] the relevance of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle is checked {{ insert: param, si-18_odp.02 }};
  - \[SI-18a.[03]\] the timeliness of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle is checked {{ insert: param, si-18_odp.03 }};
  - \[SI-18a.[04]\] the completeness of personally identifiable information across the information life cycle is checked {{ insert: param, si-18_odp.04 }};

- \[SI-18b.\] inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information is corrected or deleted.

## Control guidance

Personally identifiable information quality operations include the steps that organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally identifiable information throughout the information life cycle. The information life cycle includes the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information quality operations include editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces. Checking personally identifiable information quality includes the tracking of updates or changes to data over time, which enables organizations to know how and what personally identifiable information was changed should erroneous information be identified. The measures taken to protect personally identifiable information quality are based on the nature and context of the personally identifiable information, how it is to be used, how it was obtained, and the potential de-identification methods employed. The measures taken to validate the accuracy of personally identifiable information used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals covered under federal programs may be more comprehensive than the measures used to validate personally identifiable information used for less sensitive purposes.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

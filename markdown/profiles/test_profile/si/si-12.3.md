# si-12.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Disposal

## Control Statement

Use the following techniques to dispose of, destroy, or erase information following the retention period: {{ insert: param, si-12.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-12(03)[01]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.03_odp.01 }} are used to dispose of information following the retention period;

- \[SI-12(03)[02]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.03_odp.02 }} are used to destroy information following the retention period;

- \[SI-12(03)[03]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.03_odp.03 }} are used to erase information following the retention period.

## Control guidance

Organizations can minimize both security and privacy risks by disposing of information when it is no longer needed. The disposal or destruction of information applies to originals as well as copies and archived records, including system logs that may contain personally identifiable information.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

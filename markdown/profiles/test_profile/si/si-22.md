# si-22 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Diversity

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Identify the following alternative sources of information for {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.02 }}: {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[b.\] Use an alternative information source for the execution of essential functions or services on {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.03 }} when the primary source of information is corrupted or unavailable.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-22a.\] {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.01 }} for {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.02 }} are identified;

- \[SI-22b.\] an alternative information source is used for the execution of essential functions or services on {{ insert: param, si-22_odp.03 }} when the primary source of information is corrupted or unavailable.

## Control guidance

Actions taken by a system service or a function are often driven by the information it receives. Corruption, fabrication, modification, or deletion of that information could impact the ability of the service function to properly carry out its intended actions. By having multiple sources of input, the service or function can continue operation if one source is corrupted or no longer available. It is possible that the alternative sources of information may be less precise or less accurate than the primary source of information. But having such sub-optimal information sources may still provide a sufficient level of quality that the essential service or function can be carried out, even in a degraded or debilitated manner.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

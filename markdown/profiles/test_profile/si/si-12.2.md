# si-12.2 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Minimize Personally Identifiable Information in Testing, Training, and Research

## Control Statement

Use the following techniques to minimize the use of personally identifiable information for research, testing, or training: {{ insert: param, si-12.2_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-12(02)[01]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.02_odp.01 }} are used to minimize the use of personally identifiable information for research;

- \[SI-12(02)[02]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.02_odp.02 }} are used to minimize the use of personally identifiable information for testing;

- \[SI-12(02)[03]\] {{ insert: param, si-12.02_odp.03 }} are used to minimize the use of personally identifiable information for training.

## Control guidance

Organizations can minimize the risk to an individualâ€™s privacy by employing techniques such as de-identification or synthetic data. Limiting the use of personally identifiable information throughout the information life cycle when the information is not needed for research, testing, or training helps reduce the level of privacy risk created by a system. Risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies can provide useful inputs to determining the techniques to use and when to use them.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

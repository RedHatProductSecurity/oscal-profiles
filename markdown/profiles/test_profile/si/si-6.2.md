## Control Statement

Implement automated mechanisms to support the management of distributed security and privacy function testing.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-06(02)[01]\] automated mechanisms are implemented to support the management of distributed security function testing;

- \[SI-06(02)[02]\] automated mechanisms are implemented to support the management of distributed privacy function testing.

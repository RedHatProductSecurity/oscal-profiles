## Control guidance

Controlled unclassified information is defined by the National Archives and Records Administration along with the safeguarding and dissemination requirements for such information and is codified in [32 CFR 2002](#91f992fb-f668-4c91-a50f-0f05b95ccee3) and, specifically for systems external to the federal organization, [32 CFR 2002.14h](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title32-vol6/xml/CFR-2017-title32-vol6-part2002.xml) . The policy prescribes the specific use and conditions to be implemented in accordance with organizational procedures, including via its contracting processes.

# pm-30.1 - \[Program Management\] Suppliers of Critical or Mission-essential Items

## Control Statement

Identify, prioritize, and assess suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PM-30(01)[01]\] suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services are identified;

- \[PM-30(01)[02]\] suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services are prioritized;

- \[PM-30(01)[03]\] suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services are assessed.

## Control guidance

The identification and prioritization of suppliers of critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and services is paramount to the mission/business success of organizations. The assessment of suppliers is conducted using supplier reviews (see [SR-6](#sr-6) ) and supply chain risk assessment processes (see [RA-3(1)](#ra-3.1) ). An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.

# pm-30 - \[Program Management\] Supply Chain Risk Management Strategy

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop an organization-wide strategy for managing supply chain risks associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and system services;

- \[b.\] Implement the supply chain risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and

- \[c.\] Review and update the supply chain risk management strategy on {{ insert: param, pm-30_odp }} or as required, to address organizational changes.

  - \[PM-30a.[12]\] the supply chain risk management strategy addresses risks associated with the disposal of system components;
  - \[PM-30a.[13]\] the supply chain risk management strategy addresses risks associated with the disposal of system services;

- \[PM-30b.\] the supply chain risk management strategy is implemented consistently across the organization;

- \[PM-30c.\] the supply chain risk management strategy is reviewed and updated {{ insert: param, pm-30_odp }} or as required to address organizational changes.

## Control guidance

An organization-wide supply chain risk management strategy includes an unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk appetite and tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the supply chain risk management strategy, and the associated roles and responsibilities. Supply chain risk management includes considerations of the security and privacy risks associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems, system components, and system services. The supply chain risk management strategy can be incorporated into the organizationâ€™s overarching risk management strategy and can guide and inform supply chain policies and system-level supply chain risk management plans. In addition, the use of a risk executive function can facilitate a consistent, organization-wide application of the supply chain risk management strategy. The supply chain risk management strategy is implemented at the organization and mission/business levels, whereas the supply chain risk management plan (see [SR-2](#sr-2) ) is implemented at the system level.

<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->

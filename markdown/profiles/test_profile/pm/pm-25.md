# pm-25 - \[Program Management\] Minimization of Personally Identifiable Information Used in Testing, Training, and Research

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Develop, document, and implement policies and procedures that address the use of personally identifiable information for internal testing, training, and research;

- \[b.\] Limit or minimize the amount of personally identifiable information used for internal testing, training, and research purposes;

- \[c.\] Authorize the use of personally identifiable information when such information is required for internal testing, training, and research; and

- \[d.\] Review and update policies and procedures {{ insert: param, pm-25_prm_1 }}.

  - \[PM-25c.[02]\] the required use of personally identifiable information for internal training is authorized;
  - \[PM-25c.[03]\] the required use of personally identifiable information for internal research is authorized;

- \[PM-25d.\]

  - \[PM-25d.[01]\] policies are reviewed {{ insert: param, pm-25_odp.01 }};
  - \[PM-25d.[02]\] policies are updated {{ insert: param, pm-25_odp.02 }};
  - \[PM-25d.[03]\] procedures are reviewed {{ insert: param, pm-25_odp.03 }};
  - \[PM-25d.[04]\] procedures are updated {{ insert: param, pm-25_odp.04 }}.

## Control guidance

The use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such information. Organizations consult with the senior agency official for privacy and/or legal counsel to ensure that the use of personally identifiable information in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected. When possible, organizations use placeholder data to avoid exposure of personally identifiable information when conducting testing, training, and research.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

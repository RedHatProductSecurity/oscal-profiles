# pm-31 - \[Program Management\] Continuous Monitoring Strategy

## Control Statement

Develop an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy and implement continuous monitoring programs that include:

- \[a.\] Establishing the following organization-wide metrics to be monitored: {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.01 }};

- \[b.\] Establishing {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.02 }} for monitoring and {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.03 }} for assessment of control effectiveness;

- \[c.\] Ongoing monitoring of organizationally-defined metrics in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy;

- \[d.\] Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments and monitoring;

- \[e.\] Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment and monitoring information; and

- \[f.\] Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to {{ insert: param, pm-31_prm_4 }} {{ insert: param, pm-31_prm_5 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy is developed;

- \[PM-31a.\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include establishing {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.01 }} to be monitored;

- \[PM-31b.\]

  - \[PM-31b.[01]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that establish {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.02 }} for monitoring;
  - \[PM-31b.[02]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that establish {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.03 }} for assessment of control effectiveness;

- \[PM-31c.\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include monitoring {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.01 }} on an ongoing basis in accordance with the continuous monitoring strategy;

- \[PM-31d.\]

  - \[PM-31d.[01]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include correlating information generated by control assessments and monitoring;
  - \[PM-31d.[02]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include analyzing information generated by control assessments and monitoring;

- \[PM-31e.\]

  - \[PM-31e.[01]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include response actions to address the analysis of control assessment information;
  - \[PM-31e.[02]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include response actions to address the analysis of monitoring information;

- \[PM-31f.\]

  - \[PM-31f.[01]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include reporting the security status of organizational systems to {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.04 }} {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.06 }};
  - \[PM-31f.[02]\] continuous monitoring programs are implemented that include reporting the privacy status of organizational systems to {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.05 }} {{ insert: param, pm-31_odp.07 }}.

## Control guidance

Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness of the security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms "continuous" and "ongoing" imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider aligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in the risk management strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements such as, [AC-2g](#ac-2_smt.g), [AC-2(7)](#ac-2.7), [AC-2(12)(a)](#ac-2.12_smt.a), [AC-2(7)(b)](#ac-2.7_smt.b), [AC-2(7)(c)](#ac-2.7_smt.c), [AC-17(1)](#ac-17.1), [AT-4a](#at-4_smt.a), [AU-13](#au-13), [AU-13(1)](#au-13.1), [AU-13(2)](#au-13.2), [CA-7](#ca-7), [CM-3f](#cm-3_smt.f), [CM-6d](#cm-6_smt.d), [CM-11c](#cm-11_smt.c), [IR-5](#ir-5), [MA-2b](#ma-2_smt.b), [MA-3a](#ma-3_smt.a), [MA-4a](#ma-4_smt.a), [PE-3d](#pe-3_smt.d), [PE-6](#pe-6), [PE-14b](#pe-14_smt.b), [PE-16](#pe-16), [PE-20](#pe-20), [PM-6](#pm-6), [PM-23](#pm-23), [PS-7e](#ps-7_smt.e), [SA-9c](#sa-9_smt.c), [SC-5(3)(b)](#sc-5.3_smt.b), [SC-7a](#sc-7_smt.a), [SC-7(24)(b)](#sc-7.24_smt.b), [SC-18b](#sc-18_smt.b), [SC-43b](#sc-43_smt.b), [SI-4](#si-4).

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

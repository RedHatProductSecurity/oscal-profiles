# pm-28 - \[Program Management\] Risk Framing

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Identify and document:

  - \[1.\] Assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk responses, and risk monitoring;
  - \[2.\] Constraints affecting risk assessments, risk responses, and risk monitoring;
  - \[3.\] Priorities and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk; and
  - \[4.\] Organizational risk tolerance;

- \[b.\] Distribute the results of risk framing activities to {{ insert: param, pm-28_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[c.\] Review and update risk framing considerations {{ insert: param, pm-28_odp.02 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PM-28a.\]

  - \[PM-28a.01\]

    - \[PM-28a.01[01]\] assumptions affecting risk assessments are identified and documented;
    - \[PM-28a.01[02]\] assumptions affecting risk responses are identified and documented;
    - \[PM-28a.01[03]\] assumptions affecting risk monitoring are identified and documented;

  - \[PM-28a.02\]

    - \[PM-28a.02[01]\] constraints affecting risk assessments are identified and documented;
    - \[PM-28a.02[02]\] constraints affecting risk responses are identified and documented;
    - \[PM-28a.02[03]\] constraints affecting risk monitoring are identified and documented;

  - \[PM-28a.03\]

    - \[PM-28a.03[01]\] priorities considered by the organization for managing risk are identified and documented;
    - \[PM-28a.03[02]\] trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk are identified and documented;

  - \[PM-28a.04\] organizational risk tolerance is identified and documented;

- \[PM-28b.\] the results of risk framing activities are distributed to {{ insert: param, pm-28_odp.01 }};

- \[PM-28c.\] risk framing considerations are reviewed and updated {{ insert: param, pm-28_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Risk framing is most effective when conducted at the organization level and in consultation with stakeholders throughout the organization including mission, business, and system owners. The assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, priorities, and trade-offs identified as part of the risk framing process inform the risk management strategy, which in turn informs the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring activities. Risk framing results are shared with organizational personnel, including mission and business owners, information owners or stewards, system owners, authorizing officials, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, and senior accountable official for risk management.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

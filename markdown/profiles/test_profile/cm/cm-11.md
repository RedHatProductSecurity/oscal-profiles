# cm-11 - \[Configuration Management\] User-installed Software

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Establish {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.01 }} governing the installation of software by users;

- \[b.\] Enforce software installation policies through the following methods: {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.02 }} ; and

- \[c.\] Monitor policy compliance {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.03 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-11a.\] {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.01 }} governing the installation of software by users are established;

- \[CM-11b.\] software installation policies are enforced through {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.02 }};

- \[CM-11c.\] compliance with {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.01 }} is monitored {{ insert: param, cm-11_odp.03 }}.

## Control guidance

If provided the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational systems. To maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include updates and security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from organization-approved "app stores." Prohibited software installations include software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially malicious. Policies selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated methods.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

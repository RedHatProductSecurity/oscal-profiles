## Control Statement

After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-04(02)[01]\] the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[02]\] the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[03]\] the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[04]\] the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[05]\] the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes;

- \[CM-04(02)[06]\] the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes.

## Control guidance

Implementation in this context refers to installing changed code in the operational system that may have an impact on security or privacy controls.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

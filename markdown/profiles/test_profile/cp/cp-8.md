# cp-8 - \[Contingency Planning\] Telecommunications Services

## Control Statement

Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-08_odp.01 }} for essential mission and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-08_odp.02 }} when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or storage sites.

## Control Assessment Objective

alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-08_odp.01 }} , are established for essential mission and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-08_odp.02 }} when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or storage sites.

## Control guidance

Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate processing and storage sites are in scope for [CP-8](#cp-8) . Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines, network-based approaches to telecommunications, or the use of satellites. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements.

<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

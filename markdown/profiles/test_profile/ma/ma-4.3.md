# ma-4.3 - \[Maintenance\] Comparable Security and Sanitization

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Require that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

- \[(b)\] Remove the component to be serviced from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational information); and after the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the component (for potentially malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[MA-04(03)(a)\]

  - \[MA-04(03)(a)[01]\] nonlocal maintenance services are required to be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced;
  - \[MA-04(03)(a)[02]\] nonlocal diagnostic services are required to be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

- \[MA-04(03)(b)\]

  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[01]\] the component to be serviced is removed from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services;
  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[02]\] the component to be serviced is sanitized (for organizational information);
  - \[MA-04(03)(b)[03]\] the component is inspected and sanitized (for potentially malicious software) after the service is performed and before reconnecting the component to the system.

## Control guidance

Comparable security capability on systems, diagnostic tools, and equipment providing maintenance services implies that the implemented controls on those systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on the system being serviced.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

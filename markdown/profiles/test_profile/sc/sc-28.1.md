# sc-28.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }}: {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-28(01)[01]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }} at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }};

- \[SC-28(01)[02]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.01 }} at rest on {{ insert: param, sc-28.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# sc-34.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Integrity Protection on Read-only Media

## Control Statement

Protect the integrity of information prior to storage on read-only media and control the media after such information has been recorded onto the media.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-34(02)[01]\] the integrity of information is protected prior to storage on read-only media;

- \[SC-34(02)[02]\] the media is controlled after such information has been recorded onto the media;

## Control guidance

Controls prevent the substitution of media into systems or the reprogramming of programmable read-only media prior to installation into the systems. Integrity protection controls include a combination of prevention, detection, and response.

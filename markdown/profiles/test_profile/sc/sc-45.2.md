## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Identify a secondary authoritative time source that is in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source; and

- \[(b)\] Synchronize the internal system clocks to the secondary authoritative time source if the primary authoritative time source is unavailable.

- \[SC-45(02)(b)\] the internal system clocks are synchronized to the secondary authoritative time source if the primary authoritative time source is unavailable.

It may be necessary to employ geolocation information to determine that the secondary authoritative time source is in a different geographic region.

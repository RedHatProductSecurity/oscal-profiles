# sc-11.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Irrefutable Communications Path

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Provide a trusted communications path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communications paths; and

- \[(b)\] Initiate the trusted communications path for communications between the {{ insert: param, sc-11.01_odp }} of the system and the user.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-11(01)(a)\] a trusted communication path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communication paths is provided;

- \[SC-11(01)(b)\] the trusted communication path for communications between the {{ insert: param, sc-11.01_odp }} of the system and the user is initiated.

## Control guidance

An irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as a trusted system component. For example, the trusted path may appear in an area of the display that other applications cannot access or be based on the presence of an identifier that cannot be spoofed.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# sc-3.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Access and Flow Control Functions

## Control Statement

Isolate security functions enforcing access and information flow control from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-03(02)[01]\] security functions enforcing access control are isolated from non-security functions;

- \[SC-03(02)[02]\] security functions enforcing access control are isolated from other security functions;

- \[SC-03(02)[03]\] security functions enforcing information flow control are isolated from non-security functions;

- \[SC-03(02)[04]\] security functions enforcing information flow control are isolated from other security functions.

## Control guidance

Security function isolation occurs because of implementation. The functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated from access and flow control enforcement functions include auditing, intrusion detection, and malicious code protection functions.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

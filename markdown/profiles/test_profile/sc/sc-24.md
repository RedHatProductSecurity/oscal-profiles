# sc-24 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Fail in Known State

## Control Statement

Fail to a {{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.02 }} for the following failures on the indicated components while preserving {{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.03 }} in failure: {{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.01 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

{{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.01 }} fail to a {{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.02 }} while preserving {{ insert: param, sc-24_odp.03 }} in failure.

## Control guidance

Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the mission and business needs of organizations. Failure in a known state prevents the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode with less disruption of mission and business processes.

<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->

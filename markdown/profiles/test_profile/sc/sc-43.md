# sc-43 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Usage Restrictions

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Establish usage restrictions and implementation guidelines for the following system components: {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} ; and

- \[b.\] Authorize, monitor, and control the use of such components within the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-43a.\] usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are established for {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }};

- \[SC-43b.\]

  - \[SC-43b.[01]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is authorized within the system;
  - \[SC-43b.[02]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is monitored within the system;
  - \[SC-43b.[03]\] the use of {{ insert: param, sc-43_odp }} is controlled within the system.

## Control guidance

Usage restrictions apply to all system components including but not limited to mobile code, mobile devices, wireless access, and wired and wireless peripheral components (e.g., copiers, printers, scanners, optical devices, and other similar technologies). The usage restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for system components to cause damage to the system and help to ensure that only authorized system use occurs.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

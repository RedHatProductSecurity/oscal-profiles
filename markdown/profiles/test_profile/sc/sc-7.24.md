# sc-7.24 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Personally Identifiable Information

## Control Statement

For systems that process personally identifiable information:

- \[(a)\] Apply the following processing rules to data elements of personally identifiable information: {{ insert: param, sc-07.24_odp }};

- \[(b)\] Monitor for permitted processing at the external interfaces to the system and at key internal boundaries within the system;

- \[(c)\] Document each processing exception; and

- \[(d)\] Review and remove exceptions that are no longer supported.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-07(24)(a)\] {{ insert: param, sc-07.24_odp }} are applied to data elements of personally identifiable information on systems that process personally identifiable information;

- \[SC-07(24)(b)\]

  - \[SC-07(24)(b)[01]\] permitted processing is monitored at the external interfaces to the systems that process personally identifiable information;
  - \[SC-07(24)(b)[02]\] permitted processing is monitored at key internal boundaries within the systems that process personally identifiable information;

- \[SC-07(24)(c)\] each processing exception is documented for systems that process personally identifiable information;

- \[SC-07(24)(d)\]

  - \[SC-07(24)(d)[01]\] exceptions for systems that process personally identifiable information are reviewed;
  - \[SC-07(24)(d)[02]\] exceptions for systems that process personally identifiable information that are no longer supported are removed.

## Control guidance

Managing the processing of personally identifiable information is an important aspect of protecting an individualâ€™s privacy. Applying, monitoring for, and documenting exceptions to processing rules ensure that personally identifiable information is processed only in accordance with established privacy requirements.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

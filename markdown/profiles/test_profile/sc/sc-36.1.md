# sc-36.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Polling Techniques

## Control Statement

- \[(a)\] Employ polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to the following processing and storage components: {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.01 }} ; and

- \[(b)\] Take the following actions in response to identified faults, errors, or compromises: {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.02 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-36(01)(a)\] polling techniques are employed to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.01 }};

- \[SC-36(01)(b)\] {{ insert: param, sc-36.01_odp.02 }} are taken in response to identified faults, errors, or compromise.

## Control guidance

Distributed processing and/or storage may be used to reduce opportunities for adversaries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational information and systems. However, the distribution of processing and storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one or more of the components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content from the distributed components and subsequently votes on the outcomes. Polling identifies potential faults, compromises, or errors in the distributed processing and storage components.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# ca-6.1 - \[Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring\] Joint Authorization â€” Intra-organization

## Control Statement

Employ a joint authorization process for the system that includes multiple authorizing officials from the same organization conducting the authorization.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CA-06(01)[01]\] a joint authorization process is employed for the system;

- \[CA-06(01)[02]\] the joint authorization process employed for the system includes multiple authorizing officials from the same organization conducting the authorization.

## Control guidance

Assigning multiple authorizing officials from the same organization to serve as co-authorizing officials for the system increases the level of independence in the risk-based decision-making process. It also implements the concepts of separation of duties and dual authorization as applied to the system authorization process. The intra-organization joint authorization process is most relevant for connected systems, shared systems, and systems with multiple information owners.

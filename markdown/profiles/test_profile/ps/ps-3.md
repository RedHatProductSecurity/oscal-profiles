# ps-3 - \[Personnel Security\] Personnel Screening

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system; and

- \[b.\] Rescreen individuals in accordance with {{ insert: param, ps-3_prm_1 }}.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PS-03a.\] individuals are screened prior to authorizing access to the system;

- \[PS-03b.\]

  - \[PS-03b.[01]\] individuals are rescreened in accordance with {{ insert: param, ps-03_odp.01 }};
  - \[PS-03b.[02]\] where rescreening is so indicated, individuals are rescreened {{ insert: param, ps-03_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of assigned positions. Examples of personnel screening include background investigations and agency checks. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and frequencies for personnel accessing systems based on types of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

# sc-7 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Boundary Protection

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;

- \[b.\] Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are {{ insert: param, sc-07_odp }} separated from internal organizational networks; and

- \[c.\] Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and privacy architecture.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-07a.\]

  - \[SC-07a.[01]\] communications at external managed interfaces to the system are monitored;
  - \[SC-07a.[02]\] communications at external managed interfaces to the system are controlled;
  - \[SC-07a.[03]\] communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are monitored;
  - \[SC-07a.[04]\] communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are controlled;

- \[SC-07b.\] subnetworks for publicly accessible system components are {{ insert: param, sc-07_odp }} separated from internal organizational networks;

- \[SC-07c.\] external networks or systems are only connected to through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and privacy architecture.

## Control guidance

Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. [SP 800-189](#f5edfe51-d1f2-422e-9b27-5d0e90b49c72) provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent ingress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

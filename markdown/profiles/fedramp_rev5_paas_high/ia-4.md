# ia-4 - \[\] Identifier Management

## Control Statement

Manage system identifiers by:

- \[a.\] Receiving authorization from {{ insert: param, ia-04_odp.01 }} to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;

- \[b.\] Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device;

- \[c.\] Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; and

- \[d.\] Preventing reuse of identifiers for {{ insert: param, ia-04_odp.02 }}.

## Control guidance

Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of [AC-2](#ac-2) use account names provided by [IA-4](#ia-4) . Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

## Control assessment-objective

system identifiers are managed by receiving authorization from {{ insert: param, ia-04_odp.01 }} to assign to an individual, group, role, or device identifier;
system identifiers are managed by selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device;
system identifiers are managed by assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device;
system identifiers are managed by preventing reuse of identifiers for {{ insert: param, ia-04_odp.02 }}.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

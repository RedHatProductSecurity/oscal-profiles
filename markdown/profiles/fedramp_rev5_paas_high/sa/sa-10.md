# sa-10 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer Configuration Management

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- \[a.\] Perform configuration management during system, component, or service {{ insert: param, sa-10_odp.01 }};

- \[b.\] Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to {{ insert: param, sa-10_odp.02 }};

- \[c.\] Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;

- \[d.\] Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security and privacy impacts of such changes; and

- \[e.\] Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings to {{ insert: param, sa-10_odp.03 }}.

- \[sa-10_fr\]

  - \[(e) Requirement:\] track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or service and report findings to organization-defined personnel, to include FedRAMP.

## Control guidance

Organizations consider the quality and completeness of configuration management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security controls. Controls include protecting the master copies of material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or destruction. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.

The configuration items that are placed under configuration management include the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->

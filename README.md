## Getting Started

### Update Existing Content
#### Overview
The workflow to update content consists of the following steps:

1. From a user's branch, modify and commit a markdown or json file within the workspace. (Most updates will be made to markdown files.)
2. A user submits a pull request to add their changes to the workspace's main branch.
3. From a user's branch, trestle-bot synchronizes the workspace content, validates it, and formats it. 
4. The workspace updates are conditionally added to the workspace's main branch.


#### Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch
The first step in modifying content is to [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) of the workspace to save your work to.

#### Step 2: Locate content
 Once you've created a branch, locate the content to be modified within the workspace. JSON and markdown files can be found in the following places:
- `./markdown/profiles/`
- `./profiles/`


#### Step 3: Modify content
Browse to the referenced file. Follow your Git Provider's instructions for committing changes to a file.
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository)


#### Step 4: Open A pull request
Once the needed modifications have been performed, request to publish the changes by opening a pull request to merge your changes into the workspace's main branch.

- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)


#### Step 5: Approve and merge pull request
Once trestle-bot has processed the workspace modifications, the pull request can be conditionally approved, which triggers the publishing of the changes to the workspace's main branch.

### Creating new content
#### Overview
The workflow to create a new Profile consists of the following steps:

1. Using the GitHub UI, complete a create new profile form and submit it to trestle-bot.
2. trestle-bot processes the form and creates a new profile within the workspace.
3. trestle-bot opens a pull request to add the new profile to the workspace's main branch.
4. The workspace updates are conditionally added to the workspace's main branch.


#### Step 1: Kickoff a workflow
Use your git provider's UI to kickoff a workflow, by browsing to the workspace's available workflows and selecting the `Profile Create` workflow. Enter the required information and submit the form to run the workflow.

#### Step 2: Approve and merge pull request
Once trestle-bot has processed the workspace modifications, the pull request can be conditionally approved, which triggers the publishing of the changes to the workspace's main branch.
